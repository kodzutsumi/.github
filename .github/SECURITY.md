# Reporting and Resolving Security Issues

In order to reduce the visibility of security issues, including potentially
malicious actors, please DO NOT open a GitHub issue or pull request for any
security-related issues.

<!-- TODO(@ebntly): Setup reporting email -->

<!-- Instead, security issues for this project should be reported via email to
integer11 directly at secops@integer11.org. -->
