# Reporting and Resolving Security Issues

In order to reduce the visibility of security issues to potentially
malicious actors, please DO NOT open a GitHub issue or pull request for any
security-related issues.

To report a security vulnerability follow this [reporting process][vuln], which is outlined below.

1. Navigate to the impacted repository.
2. Click on the **Security** tab.
3. On the *Security Overview* page, under *Reporting*, click the **Advisories** link.
4. Click on the **New draft security advisory**
5. Complete and submit the security advisory draft. (Only ***Title*** and ***Description*** are required)

> NOTE: We understand that some of the information requested may be somewhat intricate. Those not in security research should do their best to be as clear and detailed as possible in an effort to streamline the review and response process. Being overly-verbose is appreciated.

## What happens next

Once a security advisory is submitted, integereleven will review the advisory. We will never outright reject an advisory, but we may reach out with questions or to begin a dialog. It is vital that you are receptive and responsive to communication.

If the advisory has been accepted, it will be reviewed and a fix will be proposed, developed, and tested. We will reach out again for your review of the fix. Once the fix is confirmed as a resolution, integereleven will release the patch and publish the security advisory.

If the advisory is rejected, we will be detailed in the response.

Transparency is important at integereleven, therefore, whether an advisory is published or not, integereleven will publish a page in the wiki of the repository outlining the advisory. We will also publish advisories in our vulnerability database. The vulnerability database is used across multiple areas of our documentation website.
